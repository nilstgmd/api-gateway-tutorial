# Tutorial: Using AWS API Gateway with a Lambda and DynamoDB backend
This tutorial gives an introduction to AWS API Gateway service. Goal is to create a basic API which is backed by a Lambda and DynamoDB backend.

User will learn basic concepts of the service and how they can leverage it wihtin their own projects.

# Tutorial

The API we create enables clients to store custom JSON datastructures in DynamoDB. The actual stored data records should contain some basic metadata, tags and the custom JSON structure. That enables users to a query logic themselves after completing this tutorial.

To complete the tutorial we will generate a iOS SDK of the create API and show how to programatically create APIs using the Swagger Importer.
